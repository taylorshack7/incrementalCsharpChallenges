# Daily C# Challenges

This repo tracks my daily progress learning and practicing C#. Each folder is a small, focused project or coding exercise that builds on core concepts. The goal is consistency, improvement, and getting sharper at writing clean, logical code.

---

## Purpose

I’m using this repo to:
- Build real repetition with C# syntax and logic
- Reinforce concepts from the Microsoft x freeCodeCamp certification path
- Get comfortable solving small problems from scratch
- Document progress publicly and use GitHub properly

---

## Structure

Each folder represents a daily challenge and usually includes:
- `Program.cs` — the code solution  
- `README.md` (optional) — quick notes or insights from that day  

Example layout:
dailyCsharpChallenges/
│
├── Day01_WordCounter/
│ └── Program.cs
│
├── Day02_StringReversal/
│ └── Program.cs
│
└── README.md

## Example — Day 1: Word Counter

**Goal:**  
Ask for a sentence and return how many times each word appears.

**Concepts practiced:**  
- String manipulation  
- Looping through arrays  
- Duplicate detection  
- Using `Append()` and `ToArray()` for dynamic data  

---

## Tools

- Language: C#  
- Environment: .NET SDK, VS Code  
- Version Control: Git + GitHub  
- Learning path: Microsoft x freeCodeCamp  

---

## Next Steps

- Keep daily challenges short and consistent  
- Expand each challenge incrementally (e.g., sentence word counter → multi-sentence counter excluding punctuation)
